It is lightweight, easy to use, and allows for the creation of web applications with minimal setup and configuration. Flask is also becoming increasingly popular in machine learning engineering as it allows for the creation of web-based interfaces for machine learning models.'

This is particularly important when working with datasets that have imbalanced class distributions, as this can lead to bias in the model predictions.'
